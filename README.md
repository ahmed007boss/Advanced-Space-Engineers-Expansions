# 🚀 Advanced Space Engineers Expansion (ASEE²)

> An expansion for the upcoming *Space Engineers 2* that gives the player real direction—offering meaningful goals, deeper progression, and many reasons to survive, explore, engineer, industrialize, and reshape worlds, whether playing solo or in multiplayer.

---

## 🌌 Vision

When I play sandbox games like *Space Engineers* and many others, I often end up building impressive things but with no deeper purpose. **ASEE²** was inspired from that feeling.

This mod introduces **long-term goals**, **multi-tier progressive systems**, and **meaningful reasons** to survive, explore, extract , industrialize, engineer, research, and reshape entire worlds.

In multiplayer, ASEE² creates natural **cooperation and competition** through:
- **Scarce, exotic, and planet-unique resources**  
- **Unique planetary features** that players can reshape in different ways—each approach reflecting their playstyle and needs, which naturally leads to conflict or collaboration  
- **Exclusive technologies** that allow each player or faction to develop their own **technological identity**

All progression systems will be **server-adjustable**—admins can scale the effort required for research, terraforming, industrial output, and other major goals based on expected player count. This ensures solo players can make meaningful progress without excessive grind, while larger groups face challenges that encourage coordination and shared effort.

Everything—from mining to planetary engineering—is structured as a **6-tier progression ladder**, where each tier unlocks new challenges, capabilities, and strategic depth.

> ✨ **Note**: Planet features, hazards, and resources described below are *examples* of a flexible, future-ready system designed for easy expansion.

## 🔧 What ASEE² Expands

ASEE² reimagines *Space Engineers 2* through seven interconnected systems, all designed to give sandbox gameplay real purpose, progression, and social depth:

1. **Advanced Raw Ores and Resources** – A four-tier rarity system (Common → Exotics) driving exploration and conflict  
2. **Advanced Industrialization** – Multi-stage production chains and complex factories  
3. **Advanced Planet and Space Environmental Systems** – Six-tier hazard system with risk/reward trade-offs  
4. **Advanced Survivability Systems** – Modular suits, grid shielding, and environment-adapted blocks  
5. **Advanced Contracts and Colonization** – Expanded missions with scalable rewards and faction paths  
6. **Advanced Science and Research** – Data collection under real environmental conditions, with social trading mechanics  
7. **Advanced Planetary Engineering** – Dual paths: **Terraforming** (for habitability) and **Xenoforming** (for industrial output)

## 🎯 Overall Purpose

ASEE² transforms *Space Engineers 2* from an open sandbox into a **purpose-driven universe**—not by limiting freedom, but by giving your creations **meaningful context**.

You now have:
- A reason to build smarter factories (6-tier progression)  
- A reason to explore the unknown (for unique resources & data)  
- A reason to master deadly worlds (for bonuses or transformation)  
- A reason to research (to forge your faction’s tech identity)  
- A reason to cooperate—or compete—with others  

All systems scale seamlessly from **solo play** to **large multiplayer sessions**, with server-configurable difficulty and effort multipliers.

The result? A living universe where every engineer leaves a legacy—not just of blocks, but of **vision, discovery, and progress**.

## 👥 Join the ASEE² Development Team!

**ASEE² is not yet started—but the vision is ready.**  
We’re actively recruiting passionate contributors to bring this mod to life. No prior *Space Engineers* modding experience required—just enthusiasm, skill, and alignment with the project’s goals.

> ⚠️ **Note on Scope**: All planned features are subject to change, delay, or cancellation based on *Space Engineers 2*’s final modding capabilities, engine limitations, and design decisions by Keen Software House. If Keen implements similar systems officially, the mod will adapt or de-prioritize overlapping features to avoid redundancy and ensure compatibility.

### To bring this mod to life, the following roles are needed:
- **C# Developers** to build gameplay systems, progression logic, contracts, and research mechanics  
- **3D Modelers** to create new machines, suits, components, and environmental props  
- **Technical Artists / Texture Artists** for PBR materials, UI elements, and visual effects  
- **Game Designers** to balance planetary tiers, progression pacing, and multiplayer dynamics  
- **Testers & Community Managers** once development begins
