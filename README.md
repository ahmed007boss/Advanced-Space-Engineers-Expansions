# 🚀 Advanced Space Engineers Expansion (ASEE²)

> An expansion for the upcoming *Space Engineers 2* that gives the player real direction—offering meaningful goals, deeper progression, and many reasons to survive, explore, engineer, industrialize, and reshape worlds, whether playing solo or in multiplayer.

---

## 🌌 Vision

When I play sandbox games like *Space Engineers* and many others, I often end up building impressive ships or bases—but with no deeper purpose. **ASEE²** was born from that feeling.

This mod introduces **long-term goals**, **multi-tier progressive systems**, and **meaningful reasons** to survive, explore, engineer, industrialize, and reshape entire worlds.

In multiplayer, ASEE² creates natural **cooperation and competition** through:
- **Scarce, exotic, and planet-unique resources**  
- **Unique planetary features** that players can reshape in different ways—each approach reflecting their playstyle and needs, which naturally leads to conflict or collaboration  
- **Exclusive technologies** that allow each player or faction to develop their own **technological identity**

All progression systems will be **server-adjustable**—admins can scale the effort required for research, terraforming, industrial output, and other major goals based on expected player count. This ensures solo players can make meaningful progress without excessive grind, while larger groups face challenges that encourage coordination and shared effort.

Everything—from mining to planetary engineering—is structured as a **6-tier progression ladder**, where each tier unlocks new challenges, capabilities, and strategic depth.

> ✨ **Note**: Planet features, hazards, and resources described below are *examples* of a flexible, future-ready system designed for easy expansion.

## 🔧 What ASEE² Expands

### 1. **Advanced Raw Ores and Resources**

The mod significantly expands the pool of **extractable ores** and reorganizes **all ores—both vanilla and newly added—into a unified four-tier rarity system**: **Common**, **Uncommon**, **Rare**, and **Exotics**. This structure creates clear progression paths, strategic depth, and compelling reasons to explore beyond starter worlds.

- **Common**: Found on nearly all planets and moons across all sectors. Includes most vanilla ores (e.g., Iron, Silicon, Nickel) and new base-level ores. Used for early-game construction and basic systems.  
- **Uncommon**: Present in **multiple sectors**, but absent from others. Requires interstellar travel to locate reliable sources. Often required for intermediate components and environmental protection systems.  
- **Rare**: Exclusive to **a single sector**—may appear on several (or all) planets within that sector, but **never outside it**. Essential for advanced manufacturing, research infrastructure, and mid-to-late game progression.  
- **Exotics**: Truly unique—**only one planet** in the entire universe contains this ore. These are always high-tier (Tier 5–6) resources, required for endgame technologies, faction-exclusive modules, or terraforming breakthroughs.

> In multiplayer, **Rare** and **Exotics** become high-value strategic assets. Because they cannot be substituted or replicated, controlling access naturally drives competition, trade dependencies, and faction formation.


### 2. **Advanced Industrialization**  
- New intermediate materials and 40+ more components  
- Multi-stage production chains. 
- More specialized machines and rare blueprints unlocked through research  

Factories must evolve in **complexity**, not just size.

### 3. **Advanced Planet and Space Environmental Systems**

Celestial bodies—including **planets, moons, and select space regions** (such as radiation belts, stellar flares zones, or dense nebulae)—are assigned a **survivability tier from 1 to 6**, reflecting overall environmental hostility:

- **Tier 1**: Earth-like conditions—safe for basic suits and grids, no environmental penalties.  
- **Tier 2–3**: Moderate hazards (e.g., cold, mild radiation, thin atmospheres)—require basic environmental modules or upgraded suits.  
- **Tier 4–5**: Severe conditions (e.g., extreme heat/cold, corrosive air, frequent EM storms)—demand advanced protection systems and hardened grid components.  
- **Tier 6**: Lethal environments (e.g., acid storms, constant solar flares, crushing pressure)—only survivable with endgame tech, including faction-specific modules.

Higher-tier worlds and space zones are **not just more dangerous—they are more rewarding**:  
- They yield **rare and exotic ores** (often Tier 4–6 resources)  
- They provide **bonuses** to nearby grids, such as:  
  - Increased refinery/assembly production speed  
  - Reduced power consumption  
  - Enhanced research data gain  
  - Unique atmospheric byproducts for advanced chemistry  

> This creates a strategic choice: play it safe on Tier 1–2 worlds with minimal output, or push into Tier 5–6 zones for exponential gains—at the cost of complex engineering, constant maintenance, and high risk of total loss.

All environmental effects will be  **configurable by server admins**, allowing adjustments to hazard intensity or bonus magnitude based on group size and desired difficulty.

### 4. **Advanced Survivability Systems**

Both **player survivability** and **grid survivability** in hostile environments rely on distinct, tiered systems—each scaling across the six planetary severity tiers.

- **Modular Suits**:  
  The base suit offers minimal protection. To survive longer on Tier 2+ worlds, players must **equip and power specialized modules**, such as:  
  - Thermal regulators (for extreme heat or cold)  
  - Radiation filters  
  - Corrosion inhibitors  
  - EMP dampeners  
  - Atmospheric recyclers  
  Higher-tier planets require **multiple active modules**, which draw increasing amounts of energy or consumable resources—forcing trade-offs between protection, mobility, and endurance.

- **Grid-Based Protection**:  
  Certain blocks provide **local environmental shielding**, allowing players to operate in hazardous zones **without full suit dependency**. Examples include:  
  - Atmospheric stabilizers (neutralize toxic air in a radius)  
  - Magnetic deflectors (reduce radiation exposure)  
  - Climate domes (create temporary Tier 1 micro-environments)  
  These systems consume significant power or resources but enable safe base operations on otherwise lethal worlds.

- **Environment-Adapted Blocks**:  
  Standard blocks degrade or fail in higher-tier environments. **Upgraded variants**—unlocked through research—replace base materials with alternatives suited to specific hazards. For example:  
  - Titanium structural frames resist rapid rusting on high-moisture worlds  
  - Ceramic-composite refineries withstand extreme heat on lava planets  
  - Radiation-shielded reactors operate in high-exposure zones  
  These blocks ensure grids—factories, ships, and stations—remain functional under severe environmental stress.

> Surviving Tier 5–6 worlds is not about passive gear—it’s an active engineering challenge. Players must balance suit configuration, grid shielding, and environment-adapted construction to extend operational time, reduce risk, and maintain productivity.

### 5. **Advanced Contracts and Colonization**

In vanilla, contracts unlock new blocks, blueprints, or faction standing. This mod expands on that idea—but makes contracts **more varied, more useful, and tied to real places**.

Every contract happens **on a specific planet, moon, or space zone**, and its difficulty depends on that location’s **environmental tier (1 to 6)**.  
That means the same task—like collecting rock samples—could be easy on a calm Tier 1 world, or deadly on a Tier 6 acid storm planet. The tougher the place, the better the reward.

#### What kinds of missions will the mod provide?

Contracts now go beyond vanilla missions. Examples include:  
- **Gathering science data**: Place sensors to measure temperature, radiation, or atmospheric chemistry  
- **Making special items just for the mission**: Some contracts ask player to produce a unique material that doesn’t exist anywhere else  
- **Helping terraform a planet**: Deliver resources, power, or build parts of a climate system as part of a larger effort  
- **Exploring unknown areas**: Map caves, find crashed ships, or locate hidden resource veins  
- **Fixing things in dangerous places**: Repair broken stations during dust storms or solar flares

#### What types of rewards will the mod provide?

Rewards scale with the danger of the location:  
- New **blueprints** (for suits, blocks, or modules)  
- **Rare parts or ores** player can’t easily mine or manufacture himself  
- **Intel**: exact coordinates to exotic deposits or safe paths through hazardous zones  
- Sometimes, **temporary access** to powerful tools or grid systems

#### Different groups, different paths

Players or factions following different paths (like Terraformer, Industrialist, or Explorer) get **different contracts**—even on the same planet. This means two teams can play on one server but end up with totally different gear, goals, and strategies.

---

### 6. **Science and Research**

The mod will provide a **hands-on research system** where data must be collected using specialized science blocks—**only under specific environmental conditions**.

For example:  
- A **geological core sampler** only works if the ground is cold enough  
- An **atmospheric sensor** must be running **during a storm** to get usable readings  
- A **radiation detector** needs to be placed near a vent **while it’s active**  
- An **orbital scanner** might only capture useful data when a planet is in shadow or during a solar event  

You deploy these blocks on a planet (or in orbit), wait for the right moment, and collect samples or data logs. That data then goes into **analyzers, data processors, or similar blocks** to be turned into usable research.

Most of these tasks come through **contracts**, but you can also set up your own science outposts to gather data on your terms.

Some contracts will require you to **deliver specific research data** as part of the objective — not just collect it yourself. That means you might need to **buy it from another player, steal it, find it in abandoned labs, or trade for it**. This adds a social and strategic layer to science, where data becomes a valuable commodity.

### 7. **Advanced Planetary Engineering**

The mod provides two long-term approaches to reshaping planets—each with **6 progressive tiers** of development. Both require significant effort, specialized tech, and careful planning.

#### 🌱 **Terraforming**  
This path focuses on **making hostile worlds safer for players and standard grids**. Over time, you can:  
- Lower a planet’s hazard tier using atmospheric processors  
- Stabilize temperature swings with orbital mirrors or ground-based climate units  
- Reduce corrosion or toxicity with chemical or biological treatments  
- Eventually convert a Tier 5–6 world into a Tier 1–2 environment  

The goal is **habitability**: easier survival, lower maintenance, and safer expansion.

#### ⚙️ **Xenoforming**  
This path **modifies a planet to maximize industrial output**, even if it becomes **more dangerous**. For example:  
- Inject greenhouse gases to superheat a cold world, boosting refinery efficiency  
- Increase atmospheric pressure to improve reactor cooling—while making the air unbreathable  
- Introduce reactive compounds that speed up production but accelerate block decay  

The planet becomes more hazardous, but **factories work faster, use less power, or produce rare byproducts**. Only players with advanced suits and environment-adapted blocks can operate there.

Some **high-tier industrial machines only function under these extremes**—for example, a plasma catalyzer might require a pressure level that doesn’t exist naturally. Xenoforming *creates the artificial conditions those machines need to run*.

Both paths can be advanced through **contract missions**. Early stages might ask you to deploy a single climate unit or install a pressure regulator. Later contracts could require delivering massive amounts of power, defending a site during transformation, or validating stability after a major change.

Server settings control project scale:  
- A solo player might fully terraform a small moon or xenoform an asteroid  
- A large group can reshape entire planets over weeks of cooperative effort

> These systems are built to grow. The initial features lay the foundation for more complex planetary engineering in future updates.
