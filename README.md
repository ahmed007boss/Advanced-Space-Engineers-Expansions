# 🚀 Advanced Space Engineers Expansion (ASEE²)

> An expansion for the upcoming *Space Engineers 2* that gives the player real direction—offering meaningful goals, deeper progression, and many reasons to survive, explore, engineer, industrialize, and reshape worlds, whether playing solo or in multiplayer.

## 🌌 Vision

When I play sandbox games like *Space Engineers* and many others, I often end up building impressive things but with no deeper purpose. **ASEE²** was inspired from that feeling.

This mod introduces **long-term goals**, **multi-tier progressive systems**, and **meaningful reasons** to survive, explore, extract , industrialize, engineer, research, and reshape entire worlds.

In multiplayer, ASEE² creates natural **cooperation and competition** through:
- **Scarce, exotic, and planet-unique resources**  
- **Unique planetary features** that players can reshape in different ways—each approach reflecting their playstyle and needs, which naturally leads to conflict or collaboration  
- **Exclusive technologies** that allow each player or faction to develop their own **technological identity**

All progression systems will be **server-adjustable** admins can scale the effort required for research, terraforming, industrial output, and other major goals based on expected player count. This ensures solo players can make meaningful progress without excessive grind, while larger groups face challenges that encourage coordination and shared effort.

Everything from mining to planetary engineering is structured as a **6-tier progression ladder**, where each tier unlocks new challenges, capabilities, and strategic depth.

## 🔧 What ASEE² Expands

ASEE² reimagines *Space Engineers 2* through seven interconnected systems, all designed to give sandbox gameplay real purpose, progression, and social depth:

1. **Advanced Raw Ores and Resources** – A four-tier rarity system (Common → Exotics) driving exploration and conflict  
2. **Advanced Industrialization** – Multi-stage production chains and complex factories  
3. **Advanced Planet and Space Environmental Systems** – Six-tier hazard system with risk/reward trade-offs  
4. **Advanced Survivability Systems** – Modular suits, grid shielding, and environment-adapted blocks  
5. **Advanced Contracts and Colonization** – Expanded missions with scalable rewards and faction paths  
6. **Advanced Science and Research** – Data collection under real environmental conditions, with social trading mechanics  
7. **Advanced Planetary Engineering** – Dual paths: **Terraforming** (for habitability) and **Xenoforming** (for industrial output)

## 🎯 Overall Purpose

ASEE² adds structure to *Space Engineers 2* without taking away freedom. Instead of building for its own sake, players have clear **motives** to explore, expand, and improvewhether playing alone or with others.

The mod gives the player:
- A motive to build more complex factories, not just bigger onesthrough a 6-tier industrial progression  
- A motive to explore new planets and sectorsto find unique ores, scientific data, and strategic advantages  
- A motive to operate in dangerous environmentsbecause high-risk zones offer better resources and grid bonuses  
- A motive to run research missionssince collected data unlocks faction-specific tech paths  
- A motive to work with or against other playersover scarce resources, exclusive data, or control of key worlds  

All systems include **server-adjustable settings**, so effort scales with group size: solo players can make steady progress, while large groups face challenges that require coordination and shared infrastructure.

The goal isn’t to replace sandbox freedombut to give it direction. Every base, ship, or machine built serves a purpose in a larger, evolving world.

## 👥 Join the ASEE² Development Team!

**ASEE² is not yet started—but the vision is ready.**  
We’re actively recruiting passionate contributors to bring this mod to life. No prior *Space Engineers* modding experience required—just enthusiasm, skill, and alignment with the project’s goals.

> ⚠️ **Note on Scope**: All planned features are subject to change, delay, or cancellation based on *Space Engineers 2*’s final modding capabilities, engine limitations, and design decisions by Keen Software House. If Keen implements similar systems officially, the mod will adapt or de-prioritize overlapping features to avoid redundancy and ensure compatibility.

### To bring this mod to life, the following roles are needed:
- **C# Developers** to build gameplay systems, progression logic, contracts, and research mechanics  
- **3D Modelers** to create new blocks   
- **Technical Artists / Texture Artists** for PBR materials, UI elements, and visual effects  
- **Game Designers** to balance planetary tiers, progression pacing, and multiplayer dynamics  
- **Testers & Community Managers** once development begins
